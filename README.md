An example command to run the experiments is 

`python ./tf_cpu.py --root=/path/to/this/directory `

The figures can be regenerated by running the notebooks. For the real world experiments (`results_summary.ipynb`), the logs output by the experiment scripts should be placed in `experiments/logs/re/`. 

The experiments were run using:

* Python 3.8.13

* numpy 1.23.5

* scipy 1.4.1

* backends 1.4.27 (see [https://github.com/wesselb/lab](https://github.com/wesselb/lab))

* Spherical-Harmonics 0.0.1 (see https://github.com/vdutor/SphericalHarmonics)

* tensorflow 2.11.0

* tensorflow-probability 0.18.0

* gpflow 2.7.0

* torch 1.11.0+cu113

* gpytorch 1.9.0

* netCDF4 1.6.1

* matplotlib 3.5.2

* seaborn 0.11.2

where the last two are for reproducing plots only.
